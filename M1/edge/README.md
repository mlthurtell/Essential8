# Intune M1-ACSCEdgeHardeningGuidelines

These Microsoft Intune policies were put together to help organisations comply with the [Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) Windows 10 Hardening Guidance](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/hardening-microsoft-windows-10-version-21h1-workstations). These policies were originally provided by the ACSC as Group Policy Objects. This repository will provide exports of Intune policies that organisations will be able to import into their Intune tenant for deployment to their Windows devices.

The policies on this page are only the settings recommended by the ACSC for hardening Microsoft Edge, intended for organisations that do not require additional Windows hardening policies. These policies are included in the ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines. If you have already using the ACSC Windows Hardening Guidelines, there is no need to import these policies for Microsoft Edge.

While the intent of these policies is to assist in an organisations compliance efforts, Microsoft does not represent that use of these policies will create compliance with the Australian Cyber Security Centre's guidance.
